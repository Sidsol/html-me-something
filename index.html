            The Beginning
          </h1>
          <p>
            It all began, when my cousin left to Japan for a foreign exchange program, for his senior year of College.
            I have always wanted to visit Japan and this was the perfect excuse. So I began the process of planning my
            trip.
            Ultimately I ended up visiting in June 2016. The experience was transformative.

          Landing in Tokyo was like nothing I have ever experienced, the city is massive.
          and there is nothing like the excellent public transportation system in place.

          I spent a week in the city, getting lost in the many diverse districts, like shinjuku or akibahara.
          I even got to spend a day in Disney!

          <p>
            Kyoto was a city of many first for me. I got to use the bullet train for the first time to get there, which was an experience in itself.
            The city was truly a modern day interactive history lesson. 
            Castles and gardens abounded.

            This city the capital of the Nara prefecture, was literally crawling with deer!
            I spent the day walking amongst some of the most amazing and awe-inspiring Temples,
            all while surrounded by deer that would walk with you and try and eat your bags!

            This was the most heart breaking part of the Journey, as the city is a living monument 
            to the hubris and resilience of the Japanese people. The city and what it represent has 
            been a driving force behind the current japanese culture, of peace and harmony.
            It was also a reminder of the destruction, pain and suffering that we caused by dropping
            the atomic bomb all those years ago.
